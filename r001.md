This round of `100DaysOfCode` will be slightly different than the previous round, and three main categories of content will be collected here;


- coding tips and tricks, much like the previous round

- occasional challenges issued to readers to break and/or improve code examples

- and perhaps a few blog-like posts about aspects of a current that I'm authoring for that week
