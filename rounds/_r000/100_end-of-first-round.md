I started this challenge 2020-04-27 and have learned much for a verity of languages. Here's a brief recap of statistics about the tips and tricks published under this sub-domain...


```
1 html5
1 nodejs
1 rust
1 sass
2 css
2 git
3 html
3 liquid
8 vim
13 python
18 awk
23 bash
23 javascript
```


... I'll be taking a break from #100DaysofCode (no less than seven days), because I wish to focus on projects for the _52 For Peer Review_ challenge. Note, this does **not** mean that I'll stop sharing coding tips and tricks, only that I'll be less pressured to do so daily.


Check the [`52ForPeerReview/S0AndS0`][52forpeerreview__round_0] site to find more about projects published for the 52 For Peer Review challenge.


Thanks be to y'all that have been following along thus-far with my technical publications!
