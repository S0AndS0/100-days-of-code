On 2021-01-04 I started this round with a JavaScript challenge to readers, and while I learned much with that language, looking at the statistics I've learned much more about Vim; both as a text editor and a scripting language.


Here's are the counts, in ascending order, of what languages and technologies I've been learning about for the past one-hundred days...


```
1 python
1 sed
1 tty
3 awk
3 css
3 liquid
4 git
4 html
4 linux
4 makefile
5 rust
9 typescript
11 bash
17 javascript
30 vim
```


... I'm pleased with the Rust and TypeScript progress; specifically static method type hints for TypeScript, and generic typing in Rust, I've already had reason to reference when building new projects.


This round has certainly been a challenge; writing a blog post every day, while rewarding, was also a chore some days. So I'll be taking a break of undetermined length from the 100 Days of Code challenge.


That all stated I'm still actively publishing new coding projects, one per week, for the 52 For Peer Review challenge. Check the [`52ForPeerReview/S0AndS0`][52forpeerreview__round_0] site for details, and if reading this prior to 2021-06-26 consider subscribing to one of the available feeds for updates when new repositories are made public.
